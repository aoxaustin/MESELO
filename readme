algorithm parameters:
/**
	 * @param inputFile
	 *            - input event sequence dataset.
	 * @param outputFile
	 *            - output frequent episode by each time slot.
	 * @param min_sup
	 *            - minimal support threshold.
	 * @param delta
	 *            - maximal occurrence window threshold.
	 * @param window_size
	 *            - window size for valid sequence.
	 * @param updateFrequency
	 *            - when time slot is bigger than DELTA, the algorithm will
	 *            output frequent episodes every updateFrequency.
	 * @param begin
	 *            - begin time slot on the sequence.
	 * @param end
	 *            - end time slot on the sequence. for whole sequence to test,
	 *            begin = 1, end = |event sequence|.

e.g. 
 java -jar MESELO.jar ./data/alginput/synthetic/toy2sequence.dat ./data/freqepisodes/synthetic/toy2sequence.csv 2 3 6 2 1 8

MEANS
  inputFile = "./data/alginput/synthetic/toy2sequence.dat"
  ouputFile = "./data/freqepisodes/synthetic/toy2sequence.csv"
  minimal support = 2
  maximal occurrence window = 3
  window size of valid seqeunce = 6
  updateFrequency = 2
  begin time slot = 1
  end time slot = 8, which is the sequence length here.
